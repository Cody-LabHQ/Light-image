# 🌙 **Light Image**

### *High-Efficiency Image Size Reducer*

Light Image is a modern, dark-themed desktop application built with **Python + PyQt6** that allows users to **drag & drop images** and instantly compress them with **high-quality resizing, metadata stripping, and format-aware optimization**.

It’s designed to drastically reduce image file sizes *while keeping them visually clean and crisp*.
Perfect for photographers, designers, developers, and anyone tired of huge images.

## ✨ **Features**

### 🚀 **High-Efficiency Image Compression**

* Automatically resizes large images (over 1920px) using LANCZOS high-quality scaling
* Strips all metadata for maximum size reduction
* Smart handling of formats:

  * **JPEG** compressed at custom quality (default: 60)
  * **PNG** optimized with highest compression level
  * **WebP** compressed with quality 75
* Transparencies respected for PNG & WebP
* Handles EXIF rotation (fixing sideways mobile photos) automatically

### 🖱️ **Drag & Drop Interface**

* Just drop your images and the app starts compressing
* Clean, modern dark UI with hover states
* Real-time progress bar and log console

### 🧵 **Multithreaded Processing**

* Runs compression in a worker thread
* UI stays responsive during long batches

### 📜 **Detailed Compression Logs**

Shows:

* Original size
* New size
* % saved
* Any resizing performed

## ⚙️ **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cody-LabHQ/light-image
cd light-image
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Requires Python 3.9+

```

The main required packages:

* PyQt6
* Pillow

### **3. Run the Application**

```bash
python Light_img.py
```

## 🛠️ **How It Works**

### **Core Logic**

1. **Open Image**
2. **Fix EXIF rotation**
3. **Resize if larger than 1920px**
4. **Strip metadata**
5. **Format-specific compression**
6. **Save as `_light` version in same folder**

### Example output:

```
✔ photo.jpg: 4200.3KB -> 682.1KB (83.7% saved)
↳ Resized from 4032x3024 to 1920x1440
```

---

## 📁 **File Naming Behavior**

Compressed files are saved as:

```
originalName_light.jpg
```

This ensures your source files are never overwritten.
